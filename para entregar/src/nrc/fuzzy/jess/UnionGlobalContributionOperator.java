/**
 * A class that provides a 'union' operator to combine fuzzy
 * values when doing global contribution. For example, when a
 * temperature fuzzy value is asserted by more than 1 rule,
 * the existing fuzzy value and the new fuzzy value are combined
 * to form a new fuzzy value that represents the desired way to
 * combine both pieces of information. This will normally be the union
 * of the 2 fuzzy values but can be set to other operations such as
 * the summ of the fuzzy values (or it can also be set to perform
 * no global combining and just replace the exiting value with the new one).
