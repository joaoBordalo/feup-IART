/**
 * Used to build specialized FuzzySets that in have a 'bell' shape with a 
 * 0 at the left and right edges of the curve and a 1 at the middle. 
 * The diagram below shows an PIFuzzySet.

 * <img src = "NetGraphics/PIFuzzySet.gif">
 * <br> <br>
 * Note that the Constructors have been defined to make the generation of 
 * such curves as simple as possible. Only the middle point and the width of the 
 * curve need be specified (with an optional constructor that allows the number of
 * points on the curve approximation to be specified if necessary -- the default
 * PIFuzzySet is created with an SFunctions and ZFunction with 5 points each
 * so that the default PI curve will be approximated by 9 points).
 * <p> Note that this is a specialization of the LRFuzzySet with specific 
 * functions used to determine the shape of the left (SFunction) and 
 * right (ZFunction) sides. Also the left and right shapes join at the same 
 * point giving the required 'bell' shape.
