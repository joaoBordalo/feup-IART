/**
 * Used to build specialized FuzzySets that in general have membership values
 * of 1 at the left edge and 0 at the right edge. Users do not generally 
 * use this class to create FuzzySets directly but most often use
 * the subclasses of this class, such as ZFuzzySet or RightLinearFuzzySet. The 
 * shape of the curves between the left and right x values of an RFuzzySet
 * are determined by the function specified. This function will be a class
 * that implements the FuzzySetFunction Interface. In particular the 
 * ZFuzzySet class uses the ZFunction class to create a Z-shaped curve between the left
 * and right x values.
 * <p>The diagram below shows the concept of the RFuzzySet.
