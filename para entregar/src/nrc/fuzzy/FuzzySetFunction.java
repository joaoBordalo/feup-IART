/**
 * An interface that is implemented by classes that will generate
 * FuzzySets between 2 X values. For example the LeftLinearFunction 
 * class will generate a fuzzy set representing a straight line
 * with a membership value of 0 at the left and a membership value
 * of 1 at the right. The RightLinearFunction class is similar with
 * the left value of 1 and right value of zero. The SFunction class
 * generates a FuzzySet in the shape of an 'S' (lower left 0, 
 * upper right 1) and the ZFunction class
 * generates a FuzzySet in the shape of a 'Z' (upper left 1, 
 * lower right 0). In turn the classes LFuzzySet, RFuzzySet and LRFuzzySet
 * use instances of these implementors of the FuzzySetFunction to create
 * pieces of more complex fuzzy set shapes.
