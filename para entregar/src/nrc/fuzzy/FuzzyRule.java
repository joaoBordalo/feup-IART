/**
 * A FuzzyRule holds three sets FuzzyValues for the antecedents, conclusions 
 * and input values of a rule.
 * A rule might be written as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   if antecedent1 and
 *      antecedent2 and
 *          ...
 *      antecedentn
 *   then
 *      conclusion1 and
 *      conclusion2 and
 *          ...
 *      conclusionm
 * </pre>
 *
 * Attaching a set of fuzzy value inputs to the rule that correspond to
 * actual values for the antecedents, a set of actual conclusions can be
 * determined by executing (firing) the rule, using the FuzzyRuleExecutor
 * that is associated with a the rule. The executor will generally 
 * implement one of the common algorithms for fuzzy inferencing such as
 * the Mamdani min inference operator with the Max-Min composition operator.
 * <p>
 * Note that this allows only very simple rules that have only fuzzy values
 * on the left hand side and right hand side. The fuzzy package is integrate with
 * the Jess expert system shell and provides the ability to create much 
 * more complex rules, combining crisp and fuzzy values. It also provides
 * a simpler way to build the rule systems.
 * <p>
 * An very simple example of Java code that implements a rule and its
 * firing follows:
 * <pre>
        // some values used to describe fuzzy terms 
		double xHot[] = {25, 35};
		double yHot[] = {0, 1};
		double xCold[] = {5, 15};
		double yCold[] = {1, 0};
		// A few FuzzyValues
	    FuzzyValue fval = null;
	    FuzzyValue fval2 = null;
	    FuzzyValue fval3 = null;
        FuzzyValue fvals[] = new FuzzyValue[2];
        // define our temperature fuzzy variable
        FuzzyVariable temp = new FuzzyVariable("temperature", 0, 100, "C");
	    temp.addTerm("hot", xHot, yHot, 2);
	    temp.addTerm("cold", xCold, yCold, 2);
	    temp.addTerm("veryHot", "very hot");
	    temp.addTerm("medium", "(not hot and (not cold))");
        // define our pressure fuzzy variable
        FuzzyVariable pressure = new FuzzyVariable("pressure", 0, 10, "kilo-pascals");
	    pressure.addTerm("low", new ZFuzzySet(2.0, 5.0));
	    pressure.addTerm("medium", new PIFuzzySet(5.0, 2.5));
	    pressure.addTerm("high", new SFuzzySet(5.0, 8.0)); 
        // let's try some rules --- 
        FuzzyRule rule1 = new FuzzyRule();
        fval = new FuzzyValue( temp, "hot");
        fval2 = new FuzzyValue( pressure, "low or medium");
        fval3 = new FuzzyValue( temp, "very medium");
        rule1.addAntecedent(fval);
        rule1.addConclusion(fval2);
        rule1.addInput(fval3);
        // execute this simple rule with a single antecedent and 
        // a single consequent using default rule executor --
        // MamdaniMinMaxMinRuleExecutor
        FuzzyValueVector fvv = rule1.execute();
        // show the results
	    fvals[0] = fval;
	    fvals[1] = fval3;
	    System.out.println(FuzzyValue.plotFuzzyValues("*+", 0, 50, fvals));
	    System.out.println(fval2.plotFuzzyValue("*", 0, 10));
	    System.out.println(fvv.fuzzyValueAt(0).plotFuzzyValue("*", 0, 10));
	    // execute again with a different rule executor -- 
	    // LarsenProductMaxMinRuleExecutor
        fvv = rule1.execute(new LarsenProductMaxMinRuleExecutor());
        // and show results
	    System.out.println(fvv.fuzzyValueAt(0).plotFuzzyValue("*", 0, 10));
	
	the above would produce the following graphs as output
	
	The Antecedent (hot) and the input (very medium) fuzzy values
	
    Fuzzy Value: temperature
    Linguistic Value: hot (*),  very medium (+)
