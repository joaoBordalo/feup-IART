/**
 * An interface for classes that provides an execute method to execute (fire)
 * FuzzyRules. The execute method will accept a FuzzyRule object and 
 * return a FuzzyValueVector composed of the actual output FuzzyValues
 * for the rule (using the implication operator and composition operator
 * that the specific interface implements).
 *
 * All FuzzyRules have a FuzzyRuleExecutor associated with them. This defines the 
 * method (algorithm) that will be used for calculating the output FuzzyValues
 * of a rule, given the antecedents, inputs and conclusions in the FuzzyRule.
 *
 * In general each FuzzyRule should have a unique instance of a FuzzyRuleExecutor
 * associated with it. This will allow the Rule Executors to save state between
 * firings of the same rule and when possible avoid redoing some calculations,
 * after testing that the rule contents (antecedents, inputs, and conclusions)
 * have not changed enough to invalidate previous calculations. For example, 
 * the MamdaniMinMaxMinRuleExecutor implements the Mamdani Min inference operator
 * and the Max-Min composition operator to calculate a rule's outputs. This 
 * method has the rather nice property that the outputs are generated from the
 * conclusions by 'clipping' them at a value that is calculated as the minimum
 * of the maximum membership values of the intersections of the fuzzy value 
 * antecedent and input pairs. So one can calculate the intersections of the pairs
 * get the maximum membership value for each intersection and find the minimum of these.
 * Should the rule be fired a second time and the antecedents and inputs have not 
 * changed, it is only necessary to clip the consequents, avoiding some
 * expensive calculations.
