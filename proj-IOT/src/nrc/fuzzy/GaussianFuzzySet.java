/**
 * Used to build specialized FuzzySets that have a 'gaussian' shape with a 
 * 0 at the left and right edges of the curve and a 1 in the middle section. 
 * The diagram below shows a couple of GaussianFuzzySets, one where the
 * left and right sides of the curve meet at a single point and one where
 * the left and right sides are separated.
 * <br> <br>
 * <img src = "NetGraphics/GaussianFuzzySet.gif">
 * <br> <br>
 * Note that the Constructors have been defined to make the generation of 
 * such curves as simple as possible. Only the middle point(s) 
 * and the standard deviation(s) of the curve need be specified 
 * (with optional constructor(s) that allow the number of points on the curve 
 * approximation to be specified if necessary -- or use the default number of
 * points for a leftGaussianFuzzySet and rightGaussianFuzzySet; 
 * this is controlled by parameters in the leftGaussianFunction
 * and rightGaussianFunction classes).
 * <p> Note that this is a specialization of the LRFuzzySet with specific 
 * functions used to determine the shape of the left (leftGaussianFunction) and 
 * right (rightGaussianFunction) sides. The left and right shapes may or may not
 * join at the same point.
 * <br>
 * The curves are defined by the following equation:
 * <br> <br>

 * where a is the mean and sigma is the standard deviation.
