/**
 * Used to build specialized FuzzySets that have a single value with membership 
 * value of 1.0. Note that such a FuzzySet requires 3 points in it's definition:
 * <br>
 * e.g. (x,0) (x,1) (x,0)
 * <br>
 * Also note that the definition of a FuzzySet with only 1 point defines a 
 * horizontal line at the specifiec membership value and not a singleton value.
 * <br>
 * The diagram below shows a SingletonFuzzySet.

 * Note that the Constructors have been defined to make the generation of 
 * such curves as simple as possible. Only 1 point is required to define
 * the singleton shape. 
 * <p> This is a specialization of the TriangleFuzzySet where the left, middle 
 * and right x values are the same.
