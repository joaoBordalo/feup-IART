/**
 * A class that provides a special operator referred to as the 
 * 'compensatory and' operator to combine
 * the fuzzy match values of antecedent/input pairs in a rule 
 * when a rule is fired which has multiple antecedents. <p>
 * The formula for the operator is: <br>
 * <pre>
 *  u = (PROD(u(i)))**(1-gamma) * (1-(PROD(1-u(i))))**gamma
 * 
 *  where PROD(u(i)) means the product of a set of values
 *                   u(i), with i ranging from 1 to m
 *  and gamma is a value between 0 and 1 that controls the 'compensation'.
 *      (the default gamma value is 0.562)
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * Note that by setting gamma to 0 we get the 
 * equivalent of the ProductAntecedentCombineOperator.
 * <br>
 * This is detailed in FuzzySet Theory and Its Applications, Second
 * Edition, by Zimmermann, Kluwer Acedemic Publishers, 1990.
