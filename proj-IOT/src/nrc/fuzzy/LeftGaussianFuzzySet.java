/**
 * Used to build specialized FuzzySets that in have a shape similar to
 * the left half of a gaussian curve with a 0 at the lower left edge and 1 at the upper right edge. 
 * The diagram below shows an LeftGaussianFuzzySet.

 * <img src = "NetGraphics/LeftGaussianFuzzySet.gif">
  * <br>
 * The curves are defined by the following equation:

 * <img src = "NetGraphics/GaussianEquation.gif">
 * <br> <br>
 * where a is the mean and sigma is the standard deviation.
 * <br> <br>
 * Note that the Constructors have been defined to make the generation of 
 * such curves as simple as possible. Only the centre and the standard deviation of the 
 * gaussian curve need be specified (with an optional constructor that allows the number of
 * points on the curve approximation to be specified if necessary). Points from 4 standard deviations 
 * left of the centre will be 0. Points to the right of the Centre point will be 1.
