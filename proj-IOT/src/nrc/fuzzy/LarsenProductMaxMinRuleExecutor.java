/**
 * Implements the FuzzyRuleExecutor interface providing an execute method
 * that accepts a FuzzyRule object and returns a FuzzyValueVector composed
 * of the actual conclusion FuzzyValues for the rule using the
 * Larsen Product inference operator and MaxMin composition. This 
 * method has the rather nice property that the outputs are generated from the
 * conclusions by 'scaling' them by a value (DOF -- Degree of 
 * Fullment of the rule) that is calculated as the minimum (or product etc. 
 * depending on current AntecedentCombineOperator)
 * of the maximum membership values of the intersections of the fuzzy value 
 * antecedent and input pairs. So one can calculate the intersections of the pairs,
 * get the maximum membership value for each intersection and find the minimum of these.
 * Should the rule be fired a second time and the antecedents and inputs have not 
 * changed, it is only necessary to clip the consequents, avoiding some
 * expensive calculations. NOTE: In order to do this optimization it is required 
 * the the executor NOT be shared amongst rules. In effect each rule must have its
 * own unique instance of the executor. This is enforced in Rule creation, since
 * each RuleExecutor must implement the cloneable interface and provide a clone method.
