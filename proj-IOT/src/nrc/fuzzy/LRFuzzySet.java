/**
 * The <code>LRFuzzySet</code> class allows the construction of a wide range of FuzzySets
 * with relatively the same shape.
 *
 * <p>Consider the diagram below.  The point labelled <b>1</b> is the farthest left point on
 * the FuzzySet and it also has a membership function of 0.0.  Point <b>2</b> is the
 * farthest left point with a membership value of 1.0, point <b>3</b> is the farthest
 * right point with a membership function of 1.0, and point <b>4</b> is the farthest right
 * point with a membership function of 0.0.
 *
 * <img src="NetGraphics/LRFuzzySet.gif">
 *
 * <p>These four points are a fundamental characteristic of the LRFuzzySet.  The LRFuzzySet
 * will always be normal and convex, as the membership function of the beginning and end
 * points is always 0.0, and the FuzzySet will always reach unity (whether contact with
 * unity is extended or not; in other words, points <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> can have either
 * different x values, or the same, depending on the shape of the LRFuzzySet desired), but
 * never more than once. The x values of these four points are required from the user to
 * construct a LRFuzzySet.
 *
 * <p>In addition to these four points, the LRFuzzySet requires a function to define the left
 * half of the FuzzySet and a function to define the right half of the FuzzySet.  For example,
 * in the small diagram above, it appears that a linear function defines the shape of the
 * FuzzySet between points <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, and again between points <b>3</b> and
 * <b>4</b>.  Another example would be to have an S function on the left side of the LRFuzzySet
 * and a Z function on the right side of the LRFuzzySet.
 *
 * <p>From this basic template, many different shapes of FuzzySets can be created.  For
 * example, the PI FuzzySet, a rectangle, a trapezoid, a triangle, and others.
